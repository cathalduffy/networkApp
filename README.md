#### Student Name: *Cathal Duffy*   Student ID: *07387903*

TODO: The proposal that I would like to put forward is to either build a new area on my current webapp created in the previous semester, or else to build a new webapp with specfic purpose for this project.

I would like to use my Raspberry Pi, to be able to generate weather data, and link this data to my webapp through the use of a RESTful API. I would like to first send the data from the Raspberry Pi, through the Thingspeak IOT platform and then on to my webapp. 

I would like to allow the webapp to collect data such as temperature, humidity, pressure, etc Then based on these readings, allow the webapp to display certain readings such as the average. I would perhaps display this data in graph form then also. 

I would also like to be able to press a button on the webapp that would allow the user to see the camera when the Pi has been switched on, as if this was displayed outside, then the user would have the ability to see the weather through the camera in that area. 

If using Thingspeak to send notification emails, twitter updates, etc at certain periods of time, then I would like to introduce this also. Perhaps if the temperature went over a certain level, or dropped under a certain level, then a notification could be sent through Thingspeak to the user. 

## Tools, Technologies and Equipment

TODO: The tools that I would use to create this webapp include the Raspberry Pi, senseHat, Pi camera. Other tools that I would like to include are node js and handlebars to create the webapp backend/frontend, the use of json as a storage tool, but may look into the use of mongo db as a storage tool instead for the readings. The programming language that I will use on the Raspberry Pi would be Python. I would also like to use Thingspeak as the IoT platform to be able to send notifications, etc. The finally use a RESTful API to be able to send/receive data and commands for the webapp itself.
